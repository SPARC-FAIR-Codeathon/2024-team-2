## Introduction
The NIH Common Fund program on **[Stimulating Peripheral Activity to Relieve Conditions (SPARC)](https://commonfund.nih.gov/sparc) focuses on understanding peripheral nerves** (nerves that connect the brain and spinal cord to the rest of the body), **how their electrical signals control internal organ function**, and **how therapeutic devices could be developed to modulate electrical activity in nerves to improve organ function**. This may provide a potentially powerful way to treat a diverse set of common conditions and diseases such hypertension, heart failure, gastrointestinal disorders, and more. 60 research groups spanning 90 institutions and companies contribute to SPARC and work across over 15 organs and systems in 8 species.

**The [SPARC Portal](http://sparc.science/) provides a single user-facing online interface to resources** that can be shared, cited, visualized, computed, and used for virtual experimentation. A **key offering** of the portal is the **collection of well-curated datasets in a standardised format, including anatomical and computational models** that are being generated both SPARC-funded researchers and the international scientific community. These datasets can be found under the "[Find Data](https://sparc.science/data?type=dataset)" section of the SPARC Portal. Information regarding [how to navigate a SPARC dataset](https://docs.sparc.science/docs/navigating-a-sparc-dataset) and [how a dataset is formatted](https://docs.sparc.science/docs/overview-of-sparc-dataset-format) can be found on the SPARC Portal.

**The scientific community is developing new tools and models** to process and understand measurements in these datasets to generate new results, outcomes, and knowledge. These tools and models are often applied in a series of steps to create workflows whose outputs provide quantities of interest. For example, a user may be creating a workflow that inputs medical images of the brain (measurement) and segments brain tissue from these images (tool) that can output brain volume (quantity of interest). Another user maybe interest in a workflow that inputs electrode measurements from the surface of the heart to personalise a computational model of cardiac electrophysiology to quantify activation patterns. These workflows may require multiple intermediate tools and models to generate the final output of interest. 

During the past decades, tens of thousands of models and tools have been developed globally from different initiatives and stored in multiple online repositories, for example:
- Models
  - [Physiome Model Repository](https://models.physiomeproject.org/welcome) (>6,000 models)
  - [Biomodels](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/) (>3,000 models)
- Tools
  - [biotools](https://bio.tools/) (>30,000 tools)
  - [OpenEBench](https://openebench.bsc.es/dashboard/) (>40,000 tools)
  - [BioContainers](https://biocontainers.pro/) (>100,000 tools)
  - [Galaxy](https://usegalaxy.eu/) (>9,000 tools)
  - [WorkflowHub](https://workflowhub.eu/) (>700 tools)

## The problem
Despite users having a general idea of the quantities of interest in their investigations (e.g. outputs of specific models or tools they are developing), they typically need to assemble workflows manually, often guessing what inputs and intermediate measurements, models, and tools may be needed.

There is **currently no option for users to**:
- **easily find and access existing models and tools**:
  - developed by the SPARC community for processing SPARC data 
  - developed externally that could be used for processing SPARC data
- **easily assemble new workflows that reuse existing models and tools to evaluate quantities of interest**
- **easily identify which measurements (e.g. SPARC datasets) already contain the necessary inputs for these new workflows**
- **easily identify which measurements, tools, and/or models may be missing** to support efficient advancement of research efforts 

## Vision and benefits
Our vision is to:
- **providing a knowledgebase** that:
  - describes existing measurements, models, and tools developed by the SPARC and wider communities
  - provides a map of all the inputs and outputs of the available models and tools
- **leverage the knowledgebase to automatically assemble workflow descriptions to evaluate quantities of interest**
- **run the assembled workflow(s)** or **help identify missing components** that are needed to run the assembled workflow
- **store assembled workfow descriptions in a FAIR manner** such that they can potentially be e.g. [contributed to the SPARC Portal](https://docs.sparc.science/docs/submitting-a-dataset-to-sparc) 

Providing these capabilites would: 
- significantly improve resource search functionality, especially if it is integrated with shared infrastructure such as the SPARC portal. This would allow users to find existing tools and models that may already enable evalaution of some or all of the quantities that they are interested.
- maximise finability, reusabilty, and therefore, the impact of existing SPARC resoures (providing an pathway for other communities that are building tools and models to make use of SPARC data)
- support reuse of assembled workflows by the community for generating scientific advances.
- help the community identify gaps in our knowledge and capabilites to support and help prioritise future research developments

## Our solution - sparc-assemble
To address this problem and support our vision, we have **developed a Python module called SPARC Assemble (sparc-assemble)** that can be used to find, access, and automatically assemble models and tools into workflows to process SPARC datasets in accordance with FAIR principles. 

The following features are currently supported: 
- Extracting and annotating existing tools and models from SPARC datasets to help standardise and harmonise their input and output descriptions
- Accessing existing tools and models from external repositories such as [WorkflowHub](https://workflowhub.eu) and Biomodels
- Storing information about the model and tools in a local knowledge graph defined by the standardised [EDAM ontology](http://edamontology.org) (which has been deveoped for bioscientific data analysis and data management)
- Listing all available models and tools
- Performing queries to **automatically** assemble workflows:
  - List all possible workflows (model and tool combinations) that would enable evaluation of a quantity of interest (ie an output of a model or tool)
  - Identify which SPARC datasets contain the required inputs to the workflow
  - Idenitfy which measurement, model, and tool inputs are missing
- Stores assembled workflows using the SPARC Dataset Structure to ensure they are FAIR
- Provides an easy-to-use python-based application programming interface (API) to provide the above functionality
- Provides a **natural language inteface** to make it easy for users to specify their quantity of interest
- Provides a series of tutorials to demonstrate the functionality of sparc-assemble
- Reuses existing SPARC resources and tools including sparc-me, sparc-flow, and the sparc-python-client
  
## Designed to enable FAIRness
We have endevoured enusre FAIRness of sparc-assemble and the tools that it uses.  against the FAIR Principles established for research software. The details of this assemsement  in the following [document](INSERT GOOGLE DOC).

## Future developments
- Workflow and tool registry in SPARC portal
- standardise the description of intputs and outputs of these models and tools
- Integrate our knowledge graph with other SPARC knowledgebases (
- Leverage anatomical and funcational connetivity to assemble new workflows
- Expand tool descriptions that can be access e.g. Workflow Description Language, Nextflow, Snakemake etc 
- Link with Language Models to support
  
## Setting up sparc-assemble
